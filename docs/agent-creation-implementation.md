# Agent Creation Implementation

This document explains the implementation of the agent creation flow in the application, focusing on the transaction handling and agent creation process.

## Overview

The agent creation process involves two main steps:
1. **Payment**: Transferring ETH to the deployment fees recipient
2. **Creation**: Submitting agent data to the API with the transaction hash as proof of payment

## Implementation Details

### Transaction Flow

The transaction flow has been implemented in `app/create-agent/page.tsx` with the following key components:

1. **Transaction Initiation**:
   - When a user clicks the "Deploy Agent" button, the `handleDeploy` function is called
   - The function validates form data and wallet connection
   - It then executes a token transfer to the deployment fees recipient using `sendAsync`
   - The transaction hash is stored in state using `setTransactionHash`

2. **Transaction Monitoring**:
   - The `useTransactionReceipt` hook from `@starknet-react/core` is used to monitor the transaction status
   - When the transaction is confirmed (status `ACCEPTED_ON_L2` and `SUCCEEDED`), the agent creation process is triggered
   - If the transaction fails, appropriate error messages are displayed

3. **Agent Creation**:
   - The `createAgentAfterTx` function is called with the transaction hash
   - This function calls the `createAgent` server action with all necessary data
   - Upon successful agent creation, a success message is displayed and the user is redirected to the home page

### Key Improvements

1. **Immediate Agent Creation**:
   - The agent creation process now starts immediately after transaction confirmation
   - This eliminates the need for a separate useEffect hook and improves reliability

2. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Added specific error handling for different transaction states (pending, reverted, etc.)
   - Improved error messages with more context for users

3. **Enhanced User Feedback**:
   - Added more detailed toast messages at each step of the process
   - Included transaction hash in success messages for reference

4. **Support for Both Wallet Types**:
   - The implementation works seamlessly with both Starknet and EVM wallets
   - The wallet type is logged for debugging purposes

## Testing

The implementation has been thoroughly tested using two test scripts:

1. **test-agent-creation-transfer.js**:
   - Tests the token transfer process in isolation
   - Verifies that the transaction is properly executed and confirmed

2. **test-agent-creation-flow.js**:
   - Tests the complete agent creation flow
   - Simulates both Starknet and EVM wallet interactions
   - Verifies that the transaction hash is properly passed to the agent creation process

Both scripts can be run with:
```bash
node scripts/test-agent-creation-transfer.js
node scripts/test-agent-creation-flow.js
```

## Environment Variables

The implementation uses the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_FEES_RECIPIENT` | Address of the wallet that receives deployment fees |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_FEES` | Amount of ETH to send (in wei) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS` | Address of the ETH token contract |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NODE_URL` | URL of the Starknet RPC node |

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Transaction Pending**: If a transaction is stuck in pending state, the user can refresh the page and try again.

2. **Insufficient Balance**: If the user doesn't have enough ETH, a clear error message is displayed.

3. **Transaction Reverted**: If a transaction is reverted, the error is caught and displayed to the user.

4. **API Errors**: If the agent creation API returns an error, it's displayed to the user with context.

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to the implementation:

1. **Transaction Retry**: Add ability to retry failed transactions without starting over.

2. **Transaction History**: Store transaction history for reference.

3. **Gas Estimation**: Add gas estimation to provide more accurate cost information.

4. **Transaction Timeout**: Add timeout handling for transactions that take too long.

5. **Offline Support**: Add support for offline transaction signing and later submission.
